# websiteWatcher

Just made to check if my prof modified her personal site to add new assignments
and stuff I need to pull down.

## Usage

Idk, I guess you can change the URL to one you want and then run this:

'''
crystal run src/websiteWatcher.cr
'''

## Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/your-github-user/websiteWatcher/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
