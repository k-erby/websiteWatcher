Option for Notebook “Chapter #2:

In class today, we talked about issues in the creation and termination of artists’ place in the canon of art. Individual works can go through the same process.

Another point about individual works of art is that there’s often a ‘consensus’ about which point in a work’s life (which can be a very long time) is the representative or ‘masterpiece’ moment. This consideration often has implications for conservation and/or restoration decisions.

For today’s assignment choose an antique work of art (something more than 200 years old) and learn something about its history. 
Is it completely unchanged in all that time? 
Has it moved? dis-coloured? broken? re-framed?
Have any attempts been made to restore it? How much was done?
What “moment” in its history was deemed worthy to be “the” moment we are presented with?
What implications does this have?
