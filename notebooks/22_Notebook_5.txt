Option for Notebook “Chapter” #5:

Today we talked about the construction of sculptural canon in relationship
to the rediscovered works of classical Greece and Rome. Choose one sculpture
from the following list and look at its life after the 16th century. How was
it regarded? Did that remain consistent? Find a work of art that uses the
sculpture for a reference. Why did the artist choose it? What were they trying
to say about it? About their own work?

Works to choose from: Apollo Belvedere, Medici Venus, Laocoon, Capitoline Wolf,
Discobolus, Dying Gaul, Borghese Gladiator, Cleopatra/Ariadne (from the Belvedere)

Write a brief reflective response incorporating the above (minimum 500 words).
