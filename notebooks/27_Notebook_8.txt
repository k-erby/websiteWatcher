Notebook “Chapter” option #8


Today we talked about some of the issues around ownership.


For this notebook section find a work of art that changed ownership 
as the result of a clear act of looting or theft (i.e. no compensation 
or purchase was made), or was the result of an extraordinary purchase 
(such as a _very_ large sum of money). Why is there such a desire for 
ownership? What does the desire for ownership bring to the broader 
understanding or appreciation of the work? Why is the work so compelling?

Works not to be chosen: classical sculpture seized by Napoleon, 
van Gogh’s Dr. Gachet, drawings by Durer. 

Write a brief, reflective response to the above (500 words minimum).
